By default, the memory_map() function shown opens a file for both reading and writing. Any modifications made to he 
data are copied back to the original file.
If read-only access is needed instead, supply mmap.ACCESS_READ for the access argument.

If you intend to modify the data locally, but don't want those changes written back to the original file, use
